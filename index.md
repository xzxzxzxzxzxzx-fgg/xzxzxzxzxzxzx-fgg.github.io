## 🎨 Features

The stereo matching algorithms within this tool are designed to be user-friendly and effective. Here are some of the methods you can utilize:

- **Block Matching:** A simple yet effective algorithm for finding disparity by comparing blocks of pixels between stereo images.
- **Dynamic Programming:** This method minimizes the error in disparity calculation by using dynamic programming techniques.
- **Semi-Global Matching (SGM):** SGM improves accuracy by considering neighboring pixels, providing enhanced depth information.
- **Semi-Global Block Matching:** A hybrid method combining the benefits of block matching and semi-global matching.
- **Belief Propagation:** An advanced technique that utilizes probabilities to enhance the accuracy of depth estimation.
